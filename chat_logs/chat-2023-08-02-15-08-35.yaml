- content: "Sure, I can help with that. We'll use the midpoint circle algorithm to\
    \ draw a circle on the screen. This algorithm uses integer arithmetic only, which\
    \ is faster and more precise than using floating point arithmetic.\n\nHere's a\
    \ simple program that plots a circle with a radius of 10 at the center of the\
    \ screen (20, 12) in a 40 column PET:\n\n```basic\n{clear}\n{home}\nprint \"{rvson}generating\
    \ a circle...{rvsof}\"\n\n{rem: initialize circle parameters}\nlet radius = 10\n\
    let center_x = 20\nlet center_y = 12\n\n{rem: initialize midpoint circle algorithm\
    \ variables}\nlet x = radius\nlet y = 0\nlet error = 1 - radius\n\n{rem: draw\
    \ circle}\n{label:draw_circle}\npoke 32768 + center_y * 40 + center_x + x, 81\n\
    poke 32768 + center_y * 40 + center_x - x, 81\npoke 32768 + center_y * 40 + center_x\
    \ + y, 81\npoke 32768 + center_y * 40 + center_x - y, 81\npoke 32768 + (center_y\
    \ + x) * 40 + center_x + y, 81\npoke 32768 + (center_y + x) * 40 + center_x -\
    \ y, 81\npoke 32768 + (center_y - x) * 40 + center_x + y, 81\npoke 32768 + (center_y\
    \ - x) * 40 + center_x - y, 81\n\n{rem: update midpoint circle algorithm variables}\n\
    if error <= 0 then\n  y = y + 1\n  error = error + 2 * y + 1\nelse\n  x = x -\
    \ 1\n  error = error - 2 * x + 1\nend if\n\n{rem: continue drawing circle until\
    \ complete}\nif x >= y then goto {l:draw_circle}\n\nprint \"{home}{rvson}circle\
    \ generation complete!{rvsof}\"\n```\n\nThis program uses the `poke` command to\
    \ draw the circle directly to the screen memory. The screen memory starts at address\
    \ 32768 and each row is 40 characters wide. The character code 81 is used to draw\
    \ a solid block, which will form the circle.\n\nThe midpoint circle algorithm\
    \ works by starting at the top of the circle and drawing pixels in each of the\
    \ eight octants of the circle simultaneously. It uses an error term to decide\
    \ when to move in the y direction and when to move in both the x and y directions.\
    \ The error term is updated after each pixel is drawn, and the algorithm continues\
    \ until it has drawn the entire circle."
