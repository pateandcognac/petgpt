- content: 'Sure, I''d be happy to help with that. Here''s a simple program that plots
    a circle on the screen using the midpoint circle algorithm:


    ```basic

    {l:init}

    rem circle plotting program

    rem keywords:  circle, graphics, plotting, poke, midpoint circle algorithm

    screen_memory=32768:screen_width=40:screen_height=25:radius=10:character_code=42

    center_x=screen_width/2:center_y=screen_height/2


    {l:plot_circle}

    x=radius:y=0:error=1-radius


    while x>=y

    poke screen_memory+(center_y+y)*screen_width+(center_x+x), character_code

    poke screen_memory+(center_y+y)*screen_width+(center_x-x), character_code

    poke screen_memory+(center_y-x)*screen_width+(center_x+y), character_code

    poke screen_memory+(center_y-x)*screen_width+(center_x-y), character_code

    poke screen_memory+(center_y-x)*screen_width+(center_x+x), character_code

    poke screen_memory+(center_y-x)*screen_width+(center_x-x), character_code

    poke screen_memory+(center_y+y)*screen_width+(center_x-y), character_code

    poke screen_memory+(center_y+y)*screen_width+(center_x+x), character_code


    if error<=0 then

    y=y+1

    error=error+2*y+1

    else

    x=x-1

    error=error-2*x+1

    endif

    wend

    ```


    This program uses the midpoint circle algorithm to plot a circle on the screen.
    The circle is centered at the middle of the screen and has a radius of 10. The
    character used to plot the circle is character code 42.'
