    \ problems and solutions. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Problem: Clearing the\
    \ screen**\n   Solution: `print \"\"{clear}\"\"`\n\n2. **Problem: Moving the cursor\
    \ to the home position**\n   Solution: `print \"\"{home}\"\"`\n\n3. **Problem:\

    \ then goto {l:branch_true}: rem else branch: goto {l:branch_end}: {l:branch_true}:\
    \ rem true branch: {l:branch_end}`\n\n8. **Problem: Logical AND**\n   Solution:\
    \ `if condition1 then if condition2 then rem both conditions are true`\n\n9. **Problem:\
    \ Logical OR**\n   Solution: `if condition1 then goto {l:branch_true}: if condition2\
    \ then goto {l:branch_true}: rem both conditions are false: goto {l:branch_end}:\
    \ {l:branch_true}: rem at least one condition is true: {l:branch_end}`\n\n10.\
    \ **Problem: Logical NOT**\n    Solution: `if not condition then rem condition\
    \ is false`\n\n11. **Problem: Drawing a pixel at a specific position on the screen**\n\
    \    Solution: `poke screen_memory+y*screen_width+x, character_code`\n\n12. **Problem:\
    \ Drawing a line from one point to another**\n    Solution: `for i=0 to distance:\
    \ x=x0+i*dx: y=y0+i*dy: poke screen_memory+y*screen_width+x, character_code: next\
    \ i`\n\n13. **Problem: Drawing a circle with a given radius**\n    Solution: `for\
    \ angle=0 to 360 step 5: x=xc+radius*cos(angle): y=yc-radius*sin(angle): poke\
    \ screen_memory+y*screen_width+x, character_code: next angle`\n\n14. **Problem:\
    \ Checking for a collision between two sprites**\n    Solution: `if abs(sprite1_x-sprite2_x)<collision_distance\
    \ and abs(sprite1_y-sprite2_y)<collision_distance then rem collision detected`\n\
    \n15. **Problem: Playing a sound**\n    Solution: `poke 54272+15, volume: poke\
    \ 54272+1, frequency: poke 54272+5, 33: rem start sound: for i=1 to duration:\
    \ next i: poke 54272+5, 0: rem stop sound`\n\n16. **Problem: Reading from a file**\n\
    \    Solution: `open 1,8,1,\"filename\": while not eof(1): input#1,a$: rem process\
    \ a$: wend: close 1`\n\n17. **Problem: Writing to a file**\n    Solution: `open\
    \ 1,8,1,\"filename\": print#1,\"data\": close 1`\n\n18. **Problem: Running machine\
    \ code**\n    Solution: `sys address`\n\n19. **Problem: Waiting for a specific\
    \ amount of time**\n    Solution: `for i=1 to delay: next i`\n\n20. **Problem:\
    \ Generating a random number**\n    Solution: `random_number=rnd(1)*range+min`\n\
    \nThese are just a few examples. The Commodore PET has a rich set of features,\
    \ and there are many more problems and solutions that could be added to this cheat\
    \ sheet."

    \ constructs that are not directly supported in PET BASIC. Here are some workarounds:\n\
    \n1. **Problem: while-wend loop**\n   PET BASIC doesn't support the while-wend\
    \ loop structure directly. However, you can use a combination of `if` and `goto`\
    \ to achieve the same effect.\n   Solution: \n   ```basic\n   {l:loop_start}\n\
    \   if not(condition) then goto {l:loop_end}\n   rem loop body\n   goto {l:loop_start}\n\
    \   {l:loop_end}\n   ```\n\n2. **Problem: else statement**\n   PET BASIC doesn't\
    \ support the else statement directly. However, you can use `goto` to achieve\
    \ the same effect.\n   Solution: \n   ```basic\n   if condition then goto {l:branch_true}\n\
    \   rem else branch\n   goto {l:branch_end}\n   {l:branch_true}\n   rem true branch\n\
    \   {l:branch_end}\n   ```\n\n3. **Problem: endif statement**\n   PET BASIC doesn't\
    \ support the endif statement directly. However, you can use `goto` to achieve\
    \ the same effect.\n   Solution: \n   ```basic\n   if condition then goto {l:branch_true}\n\
    \   rem false branch\n   goto {l:branch_end}\n   {l:branch_true}\n   rem true\
    \ branch\n   {l:branch_end}\n   ```\n\n4. **Problem: xor operation**\n   PET BASIC\
    \ doesn't support the xor operation directly. However, you can use a combination\
    \ of `and` and `or` to achieve the same effect.\n   Solution: \n   ```basic\n\
    \   xor_result = (a and not(b)) or (not(a) and b)\n   ```\n\n5. **Problem: mod\
    \ operation**\n   PET BASIC doesn't support the mod operation directly. However,\
    \ you can use subtraction and division to achieve the same effect.\n   Solution:\
    \ \n   ```basic\n   mod_result = a - (a / b) * b\n   ```\n\n6. **Problem: locate\
    \ statement**\n   PET BASIC doesn't support the locate statement directly. However,\
    \ you can use `poke` to write to a specific position on the screen.\n   Solution:\
    \ \n   ```basic\n   poke screen_memory+y*screen_width+x, character_code\n   ```\n\
    \n7. **Problem: plot statement**\n   PET BASIC doesn't support the plot statement\
    \ directly. However, you can use `poke` to draw a pixel at a specific position\
    \ on the screen.\n   Solution: \n   ```basic\n   poke screen_memory+y*screen_width+x,\
    \ character_code\n   ```\n\nThese are just a few examples. The Commodore PET has\
    \ a rich set of features, and there are many more problems and solutions that\
